## Decisions

### When to make a decision (Timing)

I believe in making decisions at the last possible second.  This isn't the same as procrastination, which is more about inefficient task completion.  Waiting as long as possible to make a decision allows you more time to consider options. More importantly, it gives you the opportunity to gain additional information and insights, thus increasing the likelihood that a correct decision will be reached.  

### After action reviews (Knowledge Organization)

The most useful tool for reflecting on the actions carried out as the result of a decision is an After Action Review (Post Mortem).

### Revisiting a prior decision

Once a decision is reached, I don't looks back.  Decisions can't strictly be undone because even a bad decision causes a change to the circumstances.  It's possible they can be redone, but by definition this is a difference decision because it includes new information.

### How to make a decision (Meritocracy)

Work should in general be a meritocracy.  Meaning, the best approach, given all the correct data, being both possible and practical should be taken.

Decisions should be made by the person or persons with with the most combines context, experience and authority.

Making decisions is very hard practice however, because it assumes that decisions makers have access to all available information.

In order to ensure efficient information sharing, it is imperitive that all stakeholders with skills an knowledge in particilar areas can be identified, context an dinformation about the problem is shared in advance, and all stakeholders feel comfortable sharing ideas and opinions.

## Communication

### Best Practices

Open Honest Direct Communication - I'm a strong

### Civility

### Transparency

## Organizational Structure

### Less is more

The purpose of Organizational Structure is to delegate authority, simplify information sharing, and allow specialization to occur.  

I believe in having as little structure as possible, but at times it makes sense to implement these types of changes.  When to do it and when to change it is mostly a gut feeling, but if the result is that everyone feels less stressed and more empowered then the change is appropriate.

### Progression

I believe most companies and employees misunderstand progression. 

### Discipline
