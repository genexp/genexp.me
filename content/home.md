I'm Brian Corrigan

In my heart, I'm an underdog.  I love working with people who appreciate the value of innovation, hard work,
and eachother.  I'm passionate about games, game players, the gaming industry and working with people
who can share my passion for pushing the medium.  

My specific expertise is working building and scaling cloud services that operate behind the scenes and 
provide services like matchmaking, identity, friends, presence, chat, and more.  I starting building 
this type of software before most games were even on the internet, and I've been doing for 
progressively larger and larger games throughout my career.  I've been a CTO many times as well as a CEO once.  
More importantly, I've had the opportunity to work closely with great companies like Riot Games, Bethesda, Activision, 
Psyonix, EA, Warner Brothers, 2K, Deep Silver and these days I work full time with PUBG.  I enjoy studying how different
companies think about people and technology and the games that are born as a result.

I fell in love with science, gaming, and technology early in my life.  I was lucky to have
people who were cool with the fact that I have no idea how to throw a football, let alone run in a straight line.  Instead
I explored dial up bulletin boards, Heathkits and the TI-85 4A.  I came of age as the internet slowly replaced Compuserve.
I once saved all summer once to buy a Supra Modem.  Another time I got kicked out of a college comp-sci class I took in 7th grade 
for breaking the email servers.  I really havent' changed much over the years.  Learn fast, break things, improve, repeat.
